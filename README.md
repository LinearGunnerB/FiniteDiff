My second numerical analysis course did not require students to program the algorithms we learned.
I thought that was a shame and decided to implement the algorithms myself and add it to my homework
in college. The following are MatLab code for linear and nonlinear boundary value problems in 1 spatial domain and time.
There are comments on how to use them at the top of each matlab file, but if you have questions just let me know!
