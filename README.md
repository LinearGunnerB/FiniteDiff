My second numerical analysis course rarely required students to program the algorithms we learned.
I thought that was a shame and decided to implement the algorithms myself and really attempt to make 
exemplary code... Really just do the best I could. The following are MatLab code for linear and nonlinear boundary value problems in 1 spatial domain and time. There are comments on how to use them at the top of each matlab file, but if you have questions just let me know! Really enjoyed writing these codes, will post more soon!
